# architecture-and-design-website

I developed a fully functional website for a small business from scratch, using a variety of tools including Figma, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve, version control GIT, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

My objective was to create a website that is not just aesthetically pleasing but also functional and user-friendly.
